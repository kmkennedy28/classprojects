### Description
Input the number of test score, individually input them then it prints them sorted, without the lowest score, and the average.

### Topics Covered
- Bubble sort
- Dynamic Arrays

### What I Learned
- swaping variable values
- bubble sort & the differences in sorting algorithms
- using a dynamic array for an adjustable array size

## Proj 2
